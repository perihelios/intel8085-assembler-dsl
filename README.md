# Intel 8080/8085 Macro Assembler
A Groovy DSL that assembles Intel 8080 or 8085 mnemonics into machine code.

## Overview
The Intel 8080 and 8085 (which are nearly identical in terms of instruction set)
are 8-bit microprocessors with 64K of memory addressability. This macro
assembler allows you to create machine code for these processors in Groovy,
using a domain-specific language (DSL).

## Example
This is a simple (and nonsensical) example showing the use of a handful of
mnemonics and registers; the use of labels; and a macro declaration and
invocation:

```
asm {
    macro("ADDI") { reg, value ->
        PUSH(PSW)
        MOV(A, reg)
        ADI(value)
        MOV(reg, A)
        POP(PSW)
    }

    start
        MVI(B, 17)
        LDA(0x1726)
        ADD(B)
        CPI(25)
        JZ(end)
        PUSH(PSW)
        PUSH(H)
        RST(6)
        ADDI(E, 0x23)
        CMP(B)
        JPO($i + 6)
        CALL(0x908)
    end RST(0)
}
```

## Technical Details
Several distinct features comprise the assembler.

### Invocation
The assembler is invoked by passing a closure to the `asm` method of the class
[Intel8085AssemblerDsl](assembler/src/main/groovy/com/perihelios/experimental/intel8085dsl/Intel8085AssemblerDsl.groovy).
If you're not familiar with Groovy or closures, don't worry; all you need to
know is the basic the syntax to invoke the assembler:

```
import static com.perihelios.experimental.intel8085dsl.Intel8085AssemblerDsl.asm

asm {
    // Assembly language
}
```

Inside the `asm` block, you will add assembly instructions, labels, and macros.

#### Assembly Parameters
The `asm` method optionally takes some parameters that control the assembly
process.

|Parameter|Allowed Values|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`target`|`i8080`, `i8085`|`i8085`|Target processor for which to assemble (use constants from class [ProcessorTarget](assembler/src/main/groovy/com/perihelios/experimental/intel8085dsl/ProcessorTarget.groovy))|
|`size`|1-65536|None (use `autoSize`)|Size, in bytes, of buffer into which machine code assembled (parameter must not be specified if `autoSize` specified)|
|`autoSize`|`true`, `false`|`true`|Automatically produce machine code buffer of exact size needed for given instructions (parameter must not be specified if `size` specified)|
|`autoHlt`|`true`, `false`|`true`|Automatically add HLT instruction at end of machine code buffer|

Parameters are passed in an
[AssemblerParameters](assembler/src/main/groovy/com/perihelios/experimental/intel8085dsl/AssemblerParameters.groovy)
instance:

```
asm(new AssemblerParameters(target: i8080, size: 256, autoHlt: false)) {
    // Assembly language
}
```

### Instructions
The Intel 8085 has 80 instructions, and the 8080 has 78. Both processors have
the same seven 8-bit registers, plus a set of flags. The 8085 has an additional
three-bit interrupt mask, accessed through the RIM and SIM instructions.

### Current Location Pointer
The current location (offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the assembly
language program) is available as the special symbol `$i`. (This differs from
the `$` symbol traditionally used in Intel assemblers as a limitation of
Groovyâ€”symbols in Groovy cannot be a lone dollar sign.) You may add or subtract
a literal number from the value.

```
LXI(H, $i)
JMP($i + 35)
CNC($i - 0x209)
```

The value represented by `$i` is 16 bits in size. To access the high- or
low-order bytes of this value, use `HIGH` or `LOW`, respectively:

```
MVI(A, HIGH($i))
ORI(LOW($i))
ANI(HIGH($i - 10) + 7)
```

### Labels
Labels represent the location (offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the
assembly language program) at which they are declared. They are declared by
placing them on a line by themselves, or in front of an instruction:

```
start
    MVI(A, 20)
end RST(7)
```

Labels must be all one word, composed of letters and numbers, and must begin
with a letter. Using indentation to make labels more visible is traditional, but
not required.

Instructions use labels to refer to a location by name, rather than using a
literal number. For example, the two JNZ instructions in this program are
identical:

```
loop
    ...
    DCR(C)
    JNZ(loop)
    JNZ(0) // identical to above
```

Here, `loop` is declared at location 0. However, if more instructions or data
were added above the `loop` declaration, its value would no longer be 0; it
would automatically adjust to represent the correct value for its new location:

```
    MVI(C, 20)
    AND(B)
loop
    ...
    DCR(C)
    JNZ(loop) // loop now represents the number 3
```

The value represented by a label is 16 bits in size. To access the high- or
low-order bytes of this value, use `HIGH` or `LOW`, respectively:

```
    XOR(A)
lbl
    MVI(A, HIGH(lbl))
    MVI(B, LOW(lbl))
```

You may add or subtract a literal number from a label:

```
start
    LXI(H, start + 10)
    MVI(B, HIGH(start - 17) + 5)
```
